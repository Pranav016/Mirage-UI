                                Let's Learn Together, Let's "Grow Together"
                                Our goal is to help others to gain personal and professional skills in the area of
                                Technological development. The purpose is to provide a structure through which students
                                may exercise their right to freely associate in pursuit of a common purpose or goal that
                                enhances community at LetsGrowMore.
                        <p>
                                Community :
                                Meeting new students, making connections, and building relationships will all help down
                                the line when you’re looking for a job. Because you’re all part of the same
                                organisation, you know the people your meeting have at least a few of the same interests
                                as you, so their connections will be valuable.</p>

                        <p>
                                Real Time Skill Development :
                                By participating in a student organisation you can develop soft skills that are
                                essentially “people skills” — they’re the skills that allow us to effectively interact
                                with others, like communication, attitude, and work ethic. We will not only teach you
                                these skills, but will also helps you broaden and improve those you already have.</p>

                                Immense Learning
                                Participating in an organisation based around your particular area of study will give
                                you practical experience within that field. And what’s great about student communities
                                is that while you learn to use skills like project management, event planning, and
                                fundraising, you get to test them out in a safe environment where making mistakes is OK
